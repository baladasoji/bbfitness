Movtivate members to maintain an active and healthy life style.

##Challenges

For year 2021 we plan to have 2 challenges - Each spanning 12 weeks.

The spring challenge runs from March 29th (week 13)  to June 20th (week 24)
The summer challenge runs from August 2nd (week 31) to October 24th (week 42)

All members are encouraged to take part in the challenge by being active and working out in these weeks (and through out the year if possible)
The activity data from Strava is used as the source of truth for the challenges, The data for each group member is aggregated and shown on the website in the form of points per each week.
The goal is to have atleast 100 active points per week.

## Point calculation
The points are caluculated as follows:

Swimming - Gives 5 points for every 100m of swimming.
Running - Gives 5 points for every km .
Walking - Gives 3 points for every km .
Cycling/Skating - Gives 2 points for every km.
Any other activity - Gives 15 points for 1 hour of activity.

The detailed calculation of points for every possible activity listed in Strava is provided below
5 points per 100m  [ 'Swim' ]
5 points per 1km [ 'Run' ]
3 points per 1km [ 'Walk' ]
